Family Face Builder CPP Project - Team 63

## Project Description: 
The purpose of this application is to provide a simple educational project for users to learn about the concepts in object oriented programming.
Inspired by "thispersondoesnotexist.com". The application visualises the concept of inheritance through the real-world example of a parent and child relation. The code also implements many oop concepts using easy to understand analogies such as bodyparts, facial features and faces. 

In summary, the project is ideal for use in an educational environment to teach users OOP in a fun and interactive manner.
